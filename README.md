# Russian Declension 0.1
Extremely simple script, to help learn declensions of Russian Language

## Usage
python3 declensions.py

## How
The script reads a csv file (here named declensions.csv) and then asks the user the correct form of a specific word.
A full list of all declension is printed.
Finally, a list of all answers is output on the screen.

## Acknowledgement
The words used were handpicked from the russian edition of wikiktionary
The script was inspired by an android app named Russian Declension (whith the creators of which I have no connection, 
and the share no responsibility for this work)
A LLM was used to make the script code better

## Disclaimer
I have no official training and limited knowledge of the Russian Language, and therefor, no guarantees on the correctness of the
grammar - spelling in the file.
